BI-MAP Changelog

 Changes in BI-MAP 1.1.0
=========================

  * Update the statistical model for off-blocks to take into account
    the distribution of spectra with the cells of the off-blocks
    (noise hypothesis states that misidentified proteins are randomly selected
    from the "protein universe").
  * Separately store and output components of Log-Likelihood and Prior Probability
    (quantitative, topological, object-probes conformance etc).
  * Enhance model-to-dataset fitting by automatically adjusting the weights
    of likelihood components such that contribution of each component to
    the random walk (measured as a variance of log-likelihood) is proportional
    to the user-defined weights.
  * Detecting clusters that could have been missed by random walk sampling,
    but nevertheless represent stable structures that are frequently contained
    in a sampled partitions as subsets of their parts.
  * Export BI-MAP biclustering to Excel (requires xslx R package).
